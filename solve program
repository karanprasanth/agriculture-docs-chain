Supply chain is defined as the line of various points involved in producing and delivering goods, from the procurement stage to the end customer. While agriculture is the most significant sector in rural areas and provides a livelihood for 70 per cent of the world’s poor, it is also the industry that provides the biggest disconnect between supplier and retailer. Moreover, due to the lack of transparency, buyers and customers cannot be sure of the true value of the products or services. It is hard to investigate the accountability of illegal events. Because of these challenges, today the world faces problems of counterfeiting, forced labor, and poor working conditions. A more direct link with consumers would ensure fair payments for their produce and enabling retailers to verify that they are getting what they’ve paid for.
