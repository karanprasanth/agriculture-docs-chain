Blockchain Technology based on the concepts of Transparency, Decentralisation and Security is proposed solution for fixing agriculture supply chains. A typical agricultural supply chain is replete with malpractices and monopoly, especially in non- developed economies. It is a well-known fact that farmers do not get a fair price most of the time and distributors play spoilsport by skewing the demand and supply to influence artificial price variations. Blockchain will be useful in the agriculture sector in terms of understanding the source and journey of produce. This is vital for both Farmers and Consumers: it allows farmers to negotiate better prices throughout the supply chain, while giving consumers confidence in the knowledge of exactly where produce they buy comes from. This is key aspect when considering the growing lack of trust in the sourcing of produce sold in markets. Blockchain will streamline co-operative operations by putting a simple Distributed Crypto Ledger into the hand of every small farmer. It could revolutionize agriculture supply chain operations through:

Automating the purchase process
Improving Transaction Flow
Securing the Supply Chain
Ensuring Integral Traceability
Being more Reactive
Ensuring Asset Security
